Hi, welcome to my personal webpage! 

My name is Mauricio. I am a Biostatistician currently working as Biostatistics Scientist at Bayer Crop Science. Besides that responsibility, I teach online seminars in Statistics because of two reasons: as a passion of mine for education, and in accordance to the compensation program part of the Ecuadorian Scholarship I was awarded in 2012 to pursue my post-graduate studies. Here you will find a light summary of my CV and projects I have worked/currently working in. Please feel free to drop me a message in the contact form at the end of this page.
